"• Team-built web application aimed at streamlining the contract bidding process between construction contractors and their clients. • This project utilizes a C# ASP.NET MVC & MSSQL backend to implement a WebApi 2 infrastructure running a jQuery, AJAX & AngularJs frontend. • I was personally responsible for creating a workflow state machine using the .NET Stateless library, drag-and-drop file-upload feature with DropZone, and an interactive AI powered chatbot which leverages Microsoft’s LUIS machine learning technology. I also contributed to implementing a real-time messaging and notification system powered by the Signal R library. • I also made use of numerous other libraries and external APIs including, GMaps, Twilio, SendGrid, AWS, BrainTree, DropZone, PDFSharp, and MigraDoc. • In this project, the team has adopted industry best practices such as Agile/Scrum with Trello management, Dependency Injection, and Service-Oriented Architecture."
